As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, our mission is rooted in connection, healing, and understanding. We work to reduce the invisibility surrounding children of incarcerated parents by encouraging voluntary identification and providing meaningful, compassionate support. Through children’s books and bibliotherapy, we help young people develop coping skills, process complex emotions, and understand their experiences in ways that feel safe and affirming.</p> <p>The need for this work is inseparable from the reality of mass incarceration in the United States. With nearly two million people currently held in prisons and jails, the U.S. incarcerates more individuals than any other country in the world. This system disproportionately impacts Black and Latino communities, leaving countless children to navigate the emotional, social, and economic consequences of having a parent behind bars. While exact numbers remain difficult to capture - largely because children of incarcerated parents are often invisible in data and policy - a 2016 study estimated that more than 5.7 million children have experienced parental incarceration. These experiences can carry long-lasting effects, including increased risk of mental illness, housing instability, and disconnection from family support systems.</p> <p>In Washington, D.C., these challenges are especially acute. Most individuals convicted of felonies in the District serve their sentences in federal prisons scattered across the country, making visitation costly, logistically difficult, and often impossible. Between 2011 and 2012, an estimated 9,000 D.C. children were experiencing parental incarceration—many separated from a parent not just emotionally, but by hundreds or thousands of miles.</p> <p>Since our founding in 2020, Building Bonds Through Books has supported dozens of families navigating the pain and disruption caused by incarceration. Beyond sending thoughtfully selected children’s books, we curate state-specific and national resources to help families access additional support. Every package we send is an invitation to connection, resilience, and hope. As we continue this work, we remain committed to walking alongside these children and families on their journey toward healing and trauma reduction - one book, and one bond, at a time.</p>',1);function b(l){const e="text-(--bbtb-black) mb-4 px-4 leading-7 text-lg indent-6 lg:mx-32";var t=u(),o=n(h(t),2);i(o,1,a(e));var s=n(o,2);i(s,1,a(e));var r=n(s,2);i(r,1,a(e));var c=n(r,2);i(c,1,a(e)),p(l,t)}export{b as component};
